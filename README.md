# YOLO Person Tracking Gimbal

A real-time person-tracking system using YOLO object detection, OpenCV, and an Arduino-powered servo gimbal. The camera follows the detected person by adjusting pan and tilt angles with two MG996R servo motors.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Real-time object detection using [Ultralytics YOLOv11](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)
- Tracks a single person using a webcam or Intel RealSense D435
- Sends tracking instructions over serial to an Arduino Uno
- 2-axis pan-tilt control using MG996R servos
- Modular code with clean separation between detection and hardware control

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. YOLO detects a person in each camera frame.
2. The center of the bounding box is compared to the center of the frame.
3. If the person is off-center, a direction command (`dx,dy`) is sent to the Arduino via serial.
4. The Arduino adjusts pan and tilt servo angles to re-center the person.

- Pan Servo -> Arduino Pin 9
- Tilt Servo -> Arduino Pin 10
- Servo VCC -> External 5â€“6V Power Supply
- Servo GND -> Shared with Arduino GND
